# ImageProcessing
This repo contains my own image processing/computer vision projects and code examples from my courses.

# Histogram Matching
Histogram matching or histogram specification is the transformation of an image so that its histogram matches another specified image's histogram. Implemented
without using OpenCV or sci-kit image frameworks. 

Can be used as:
```bash
python <source_image_file> <reference_image_file>
```

# Canny Edge Detector
The Canny edge detector is an edge detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images. 
The algorithm is implemented without using OpenCV or sci-kit image frameworks. 

Can be used as:
```bash
python <image_file> 
```
